Game of Life
============

After a code retreat at [Lunar Logic](http://www.lunarlogic.io/) starting to implement [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and deleting the code and never 
finishing it, I felt like I should finally make a complete implementation.

Setup
-----

```
$ bundle install
```

How to run it?
--------------

Currently I just implemented a fixed run state. It currently only runs in console mode.

```
$ ruby run.rb
```
